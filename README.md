# MODEC Steel Construction Project – Primavera P6 Schedule

## Project Overview
This repository presents a detailed steel construction schedule developed using **Primavera P6** for a MODEC construction project.

The schedule covers:
- Engineering
- Procurement
- Fabrication
- Shipping
- Site Installation
- Final Inspection

## Schedule Snapshot
![Steel Project Gantt](04_Gantt_Charts/Steel_Project_Gantt.png)

## Key Highlights
- WBS-based planning (Shop vs Field)
- Logical sequencing (FS, SS relationships)
- Milestone-driven control
- Engineering-to-installation workflow
- Critical path visibility

## Tools Used
- Oracle Primavera P6
- CPM Scheduling
- Construction Planning Best Practices

## Role Performed
- Schedule development
- Activity logic definition
- Milestone planning
- Progress visualization
## Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

### Level 1
- MODEC Construction Steel Project

### Level 2
- Milestones
- Structural Steel
- Beams

### Level 3
- Shop Activities
  - Engineering
  - Detailing
  - Review & Approval
  - Fabrication
- Field Activities
  - Shipping
  - Site Delivery
  - Installation
  - Final Inspection
## Schedule Logic

- Engineering precedes detailing and approval
- Fabrication starts only after shop release
- Shipping permit required before delivery
- Site installation follows material delivery
- Final inspection marks completion milestone

Logic Types Used:
- Finish-to-Start (FS)
- Start-to-Start (SS) where applicable
## Scheduler Insights

- Proper WBS organization improves reporting clarity
- Separating Shop and Field activities reduces coordination risks
- Milestone tracking improves management visibility
- Early engineering delays directly impact fabrication start
